## Voke

### Flowers in the Wild

https://makersplace.com/voke/flowers-in-the-wild-2-of-15-16043/

An exciting array of bright colours and natural shapes ascribe this canvas. Voke has captured the essence of floral hues with her subtle blending of colours. The clever use of curving symmetry within this elegant piece is redolent of a tropical paradise.

### Stirring Troubled Waters

https://makersplace.com/voke/stirring-troubled-waters-1-of-10-10615/

The rich blue shadows and contours provide a depth to this picture. I like the suggestion that the waters are swirling in an anticlockwise direction which is suggestive of things not being in order. There is a certain level of chaos, motion and change associated with water and this image hints at those with its fluid like qualities.

### A Taste of Contentment 01

https://makersplace.com/voke/a-taste-of-contentment-01-1-of-3-18607/

Voke has created an interesting fantasy artwork that’s like something straight out of a fairytale. She has conjured up a scene of which one can get lost within. There are many things here vying for attention, from the dominating mushroom house to the gnomes, butterflies and flowers. With rich, bright colours to hold attention, this piece of natural beauty leaves me wondering who or what lives here.

## Spontaneart

### Abstract dreamsland landscape

https://makersplace.com/spontaneart/abstract-dreamsland-landscape-3-of-5-18537/

Spontaneart, in this work, has created a dream like landscape through a mixture of free flowing shapes interspersed with geometrical patterns. The cloudy textures allow you to escape into a dream world awash with purple and violet hues. There's plenty to discover hidden within the picture's boundaries.

### Big mix #1

https://makersplace.com/spontaneart/big-mix-1-1-of-3-10855/

In this work, Spontaneart has created a truly engaging artwork. The melange of interesting and eye catching individual parts are combined with the flow of curving lines and blended textures that tie everything together. This is one of those artworks that demand attention, rather than cursory glance, providing a chance to lose oneself within. Whether it's a small flower with a button detail, paint tubes or woodland nymphs, they're waiting to be discovered.

### Flower

https://makersplace.com/spontaneart/flower-1-of-5-10558/

Spontaneart has created a striking floral image constructed from simple, yet vibrant geometrical shapes. The flower petals contain many textural qualities which stretch inwards to the bright pistil. The contrasting colours and textures makes for an elegant botanical artwork.

### True transcendence

https://makersplace.com/spontaneart/true-transcendence-1-of-5-14264/

Spontaneart has created an engaging digital work of art entitled True transcendence. A mostly monotone background of liquid-like textures sets off a colourful face in pensive thought. It appears to me that the exterior represents dreams and thoughts externalised by the person. Those colourful thoughts are contrasted against the darkness beyond. We can reflect well on our own lives; that even in the darkest days how we are able to recall pleasant memories.

### Butterfly

https://makersplace.com/spontaneart/butterfly-2-of-5-12038/

I can see why this work is entitled "Butterfly", the shape of the insect pops out of the picture. The forms contained within are reminiscent of floral patterns with vibrant botanical colours to match. This natural flow is juxtaposed with a digital quality made by the ascending columns intricately woven throughout.

### Visual drug addiction

https://makersplace.com/store/spontaneart/visual-drug-addiction-1-of-5-10628/

Very surreal and trippy. The black and white patterns at the bottom are a good contrast to the pastel shades above.
The patterns and repetitions do work well. I can see that the picture has many depths as a result of your layering technique.

## Connie Digital

### Meld_03 by Connie Digital

https://makersplace.com/conniedigital/meld_03-by-connie-digital-1-of-3-2325/

A fascinating mix of orange and purple hues adorn this canvas. Angular shapes created by the change in textural qualities draw the eyes toward the centre of the page. Here we find a touch of green which contrasts against the darker colours. There is symmetry here, a semblance of order amongst the chaotic pixels. Overall, this artwork has a shimmering, warm quality about it, as if heat is radiating outwards.

### TOKEN 87 - Serenity

https://opensea.io/assets/0xc5ae797a87d9d72fb7d4934a304787164a29857a/87

Yet another great piece from Connie. The colours on this one blend in well; especially the vivid green. The logo reminds me of the vector graphics I'd see as a child on arcade machines and there's a hint of musicality within; maybe it's the note like forms I see.

## Peter Bock

### Colorful Anomaly

https://superrare.co/artwork/colorful-anomaly-4144

It's like your image has a beating electronic heart in the centre; it resembles a living organism. The shadow effects are good, fading in and out. You can see the symmetry in there.

## Kryptocromo

### Extinction Level Event

https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/extinction-level-event-4719

This is a cool piece; art with a message.
In appearance, it reminds me of a 90's video game set in a dystopian world. I wonder what the story is behind this?
I'm left hanging on whether the world has ended and it is too late or whether there is a glimmer of hope and it is just the signal that has died…

## Roses

### a TriP tHrOuGh tHe GaRdEnGaLaXy (114/150)

https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/a-trip-through-the-gardengalaxy-(114-150)-5198-5198

A very colourful picture. I like the fact that you have combined something from the real world into a form that is otherworldly. The planets remind me somewhat of marbles I used to play with as a kid.

## Tamme

### salutation / salutation ii

https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/salutation-5199

https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/salutation-ii-5181

This is a style that I have not seen before; it's quite unique. Dark backgrounds and natural shapes/textures and soft lighting. They are interesting as there is a lot of space within the pictures; they are far from overcrowded.

## Bit Errror

### Ellipse

How quickly the zeppelin morphs into something more intricate. This works really well with the subtle colour shading. I like the orange to red transition.

### The Mask

https://makersplace.com/store/biterrror/the-mask-1-of-3-14694/

I spoke quietly to him, but he just gave me a blank stare as if he was caught up in his own thoughts. He stayed that way, but for a brief moment, distant, cold. Just as suddenly, the warm features returned to his face and he acknowledged what I had said; this again was the man I knew.

## DinizBR

### ***A Lonely Rose

https://opensea.io/assets/0x04f23ffaddddd335d3df6172d876e192fddd0eae/89

I like the interplay between light and dark in this piece. The angle at which the subject is captured is interesting as we see her from a higher view which is suggestive of subservience/dominance; she looks vulnerable from our vantage point above. The picture itself appears to be a frame of a film; a point in time captured from a longer sequence. I am intrigued as to what the scenario is. Judging by the wine glasses in the background, she could be sitting waiting in a cocktail bar and this still is the arrival of her date from their point of view.

### looks like you picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue

https://makersplace.com/ea1729/looks-like-you-picked-the-wrong-week-to-quit-sniffing-glue-1-of-3-15824/

This picture appeals to me from a sinister point of view. The dark colours, blacks and reds give it that overall feeling of doom. I like the effects that you have created with the glitches, it's not overdone.
It's certainly quite a trippy experience as hinted at by the title of the piece. I like to hunt in these kinds of pictures to see what I see. Firstly, I see that there is a Trumpesque suited person on the bottom sides. Next I see a replication of that suited person at the top, but more of a skull-like effect. It's interesting because in the top centre panel I see a horses head fading in and out. All of this is topped off with a fiery explosion.

## Zach

### Castle

https://makersplace.com/zach/castle-1-of-1-16034/

Interesting effects that you have created here. To me it has an ancient Egyptian desert feel about it; maybe it's the hieroglyphs that do that. In terms of capturing the right feel with the waterfall, I think that you've achieved that. Water does take on the colours of its surroundings and how the light plays off of those.
In the full picture, the stairs lead me up to the cataract and then to the blue rock. I like this rock as it's unexpected; it jumps out at me and creates interest. You have chosen an interesting character to place in the foreground which fills that side of the artwork. She is well placed to complete the scene and add interest to an otherwise empty area of the picture.

### Balcony

https://makersplace.com/zach/balcony-1-of-1-16355/

I like the image. You've done well with the reflections across the ocean. I do not see night scenes like this so often, probably because it's quite difficult to capture detail, but here, you've succeeded.

I like the dominating planet, the light cast on the water and the framing as a view from a balcony, very creative.

There's a story here waiting to pop out. In my mind, you've depicted an off-world vacation destination in an exclusive resort. Maybe a visit here is for a happy couple just celebrating their marriage. Billed as a natural wonder of the universe, the blood planet draws in vacationers from all sectors of this quadrant to observe this nightly event.

## JamesSW

### London Cab

https://knownorigin.io/edition/111900

A very interesting choice of colours; red contracting against blue. It's very effective since this depicts a London scene and those are the colours within the union flag. I also like the gridded pattern that you have created, it's really unique.

### Chameleon

https://knownorigin.io/edition/114075

This is fantastic. It's exactly what I envisaged when I made my original comment. I like the way the chameleon is hiding and then slowly pops out. The pattern is the background is quite detailed and intricate, so a revelation of the creature is all the more unexpected; you're not sure what's going to appear. This is a perfect subject matter for an animated NFT as it doesn't feel forced. The animation time is also of the right speed; it doesn't hurt my eyes with strobing.

### The Raven

https://knownorigin.io/edition/118550

I like the textures you have used in this image, it's a neat effect. The yellowing background and subtle use of flowers at the bottom conjures up images of this piece as a work of graffiti on a wall of a disused building.

## ClayCal303

### Mycellia Full #1

https://rarebits.io/item/fanbits/3140

It's a good picture, it reminds me of a closeup of a fungus. It's the browns and off white colours along with the shapes that prompt me to think that.

## UrBen

### Zen 禪

https://opensea.io/assets/0xfea5b4cbe821ebffad4d68ef04bbb1963a1fc48d/6

A great picture; it's very mesmerizing. I see the globules as representations of state. Sometimes we are constricted, like the ones packed tightly in the centre. At other times we have more freedom to move and create as represented by the larger spheres on the outside. In life, we flip-flop from one state to the other.

### Intent #01/02

https://opensea.io/assets/0xfea5b4cbe821ebffad4d68ef04bbb1963a1fc48d/2

I appreciate the organic nature within the flow of the sphere. The initial, chaotic burst, followed by a gentle return to equilibrium is captivating.

A gas giant in the background throws eternal shade on it's smaller companion star. A sudden supernova and a dispersion of hot gases into the universe is all that remains of once majestic celestial body; a binary system is no more.

### Vīrya 能源

https://opensea.io/assets/0xfea5b4cbe821ebffad4d68ef04bbb1963a1fc48d/11

A very apt title for this piece. This is much how I imagine the early universe would have behaved. A tightly packed ball of energy just waiting for that trigger of imbalance. Then an explosive thrusting of matter outwards. Let's hope we don't see the reversal of that process in my lifetime!

### Vitarka 尋

https://opensea.io/assets/0xfea5b4cbe821ebffad4d68ef04bbb1963a1fc48d/14

It's like a sea of matter swirling without purpose in space. The equilibrium shifts and matter congeals into form. Suddenly, without warning a planetoid pops into existence, quickly followed by a second and then a third. This state of balance is very short-lived as a cataclysmic explosion disrupts the harmony, and so the universal cycle repeats.

### Maitrī 慈

https://opensea.io/assets/0xfea5b4cbe821ebffad4d68ef04bbb1963a1fc48d/18

They do say that when meditating to concentrate on the breathing. It's the breath that brings you back when you stray to catch a wayward thought. This artwork reminds me of that consistency of breath. The opening at the top is very reminiscent of the mouth inhaling and exhaling, everything moving rhythmically and in unison. This piece is very relaxing to watch. The lack of colour means that you have no distractions.

## MightyMoose

### The Fog

https://dapp.knownorigin.io/edition/121900

A clever use of typefaces, positioning and words make the poem interesting. The last line is the clincher for me; a juxtaposition of clearly seeing against a fog - very clever.

In terms of the artwork, good use of neon colours, the glitching is not too overpowering and I can read the poem. I like the fact that you have moved it off-centre in the image.

## Mighty Moose &amp Rizzle

### Father/Son Time (the googly eyes series)

https://dapp.knownorigin.io/edition/115775

So what do I like about this picture - the glitchy dark background effects are very clever. The fact that it isn't the same texture across the whole background fascinates. I think also that the spinning crypto symbols in their eyes are a neat touch too. It's like the two coins are dreaming big. Also, the subtleties with the choice of crypto logos, BTC in the father's eyes, ETH in the son's, a clever reference to the value of the aforementioned currencies.

## Artplusbrad

### 2001 OM02

https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/2001-om02-7398

A planetary system of perfectly uniform bodies rotating around a central body. Dark gravity spheres form a protective layer around each. Gaseous purple clouds formed within the interstice. This is what I see from my celestial telescope beyond the Oort cloud; the resolution cranked up to maximum. One day man will have built ships to travel these distances, but will he survive the journey?

## BlackBoxDotArt &amp abysms

### The Bear and the Maiden(s) Fair

https://knownorigin.io/edition/122575

There are a number of dimensions to this. I see the dark, blue background as being very much mood orientated, with the overall graininess somewhat reminiscent of unclear thinking; of indecisiveness. The girls have conjured up their own bear which appears; its large arm entraps them. This is a world of their own making and a wretched one it is. Each soul trapped in a torrid prison, their dour faces allude to their plight.

In the distance I see light; I also see that the bear is not yet fully manifested in this world. There is yet hope for them, but will they escape their confines?

## GiselX

### A Self-Revealing Reflection

https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/a-self-revealing-reflection-7067

Nice symmetry and motion within this piece. the bright lights of Times Square does make a good subject matter, but I'd have never known that this is the seed of this image. Now it is mentioned, I can see hints of the buildings, although your effects have worked well to obscure and transform them into something new.

Humans have an inbuilt, natural ability to see faces, when in reality, there are none. This work is no exception as I see a face, with wide eyes, staring back at me.

## Bitjamin Franklin

### Elation

https://makersplace.com/bitjamin/elation-1-of-5-17265/

This dark-toned piece is full of space. There is good interplay between light and dark. Dark tree forms extend skywards from their hilltop base, suggestive of the expanse above. Within this expanse are three heads, the middle of the three is set back further into the picture providing a perspective shift. This is a meeting of one’s own mind projecting thoughts inwards to the self. The composition is of two different styles which act to confirm the convergence of those contrasting thoughts.

## DabDragon

### COLORFUL CHAOS AT DABSTATION 1

https://opensea.io/assets/0xa408baab333a0dfdf0055ddde9f2322ceb2d4cf9/38

This reminds me of a planet that has gotten too close to its sun. The fire is raging and ravaging the surface. The view has been taken from a ship far out in the galaxy, with sensors in the infra-red spectrum. The image has been reconstructed in the viewscope, but even from this distance, the heat shield cannot hold.
